            <br><hr>

            <p>
                AI (artificial intelligence) is the mimicking of human intelligence which is processed by a computer/ 
            robot to preform common tasks that is associated with human intelligence like the ability to reason, 
            discover meaning and learn from past experiences (Copeland, 2023). There are two types of AI weak and 
            strong. Weak AI is a system designed and trained for a specific task but cannot work without human 
            interactions e.g. (Alexa or computer chess). Strong AI is a system that can solve tasks and problems 
            without human interaction e.g.(self-driving cars).

                            Learn- AI systems have the ability to learn from data allowing the system to ingest large amounts of information

                        <li>
                            Reason – AI can analyse information and make logical decisions based on logic and rules given to it. Which can range from 
                            simple to complex problems.

                        <li>
                            Remember- AI systems have the ability to retain information so that when new problems with the same type of solution 
                            it can pick it up very quickly

                This the organizing, collection, processing and distribution of information. It’s a combination of data, processing and people 
            working to support operations, management and decision-making in an organisation. Through the use of computer systems and other 
            technologies, information systems for businesses give organisations the information they need to run themselves successfully and 
            efficiently. (Miss, 2023) (Copeland, 2023)

                It can be very difficult to sometimes make sense of the diagrams and graphs. It can sometimes the information 
            can be misinterpreted or the data can be designed wrong and the diagram could be biased or hard to interoperate.

                large amounts of data and give accurate feedback makes AI the perfect tool to use. For instance, AI can handle 
                repetitive tasks and if give the right data will rarely have errors even if it is complex strategic work. Ai also 
                has the ability to recognize patterns meaning it will greatly assist in help managers make better decisions allowing 
                for faster decisions on being made. As well as being advantageous it is cost effective for the business its like

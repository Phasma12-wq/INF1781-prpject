                    A collection of interconnected parts used to gather, store, process, and provide data, and digital goods, 
                    otherwise known as an information system (IS). Information systems are essential for businesses and other 
                    organizations to run and oversee their daily operations, communicate with suppliers and consumers, and 
                    fight in the market. Electronic markets and interorganizational supply networks are managed by information 
                    systems. Businesses often employ information systems to handle their human resources, process financial 
                    accounts, and market to prospective consumers online.

                Business systems integration involves consolidating information and data from various areas of a company 
                into a single, accessible location. The aim is to connect internal systems, such as those used to track 
                new clients, with the company's data collection tools. Essentially, business systems integration ensures 
                that all of a company's software tools work together harmoniously.

            <p>
                Businesses can implement the following practices in order to achieve optimal integration:
            </p>
            
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <u>Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)</u>: This is a comprehensive process that utilizes software and digital technology to integrate data. Aiming to simplify and automate data processes without 
                    requiring major changes to existing operations. EAI functions as a middleware framework, bridging multiple software systems and databases. 
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    <u>Data Integration</u>: Data integration combines data from various sources into a unified view, often involving a master server that accesses data from internal and external 
                    sources. Users can access data seamlessly, and the server retrieves the necessary information from different sources, presenting it in a consolidated 
                    form to enhance business operations. 
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>
                    <u>Electronic Document Integration/Interchange</u>: This process is commonly used in business-to-business (B2B) interactions, allowing companies to electronically 
                    exchange business documents. Electronic document integration often employs standardised formats to create consistent electronic documents, simplifying and 
                    accelerating business transactions. 
                </li>

            <h2>The Five Steps for Incorporating Business Systems Integration</h2>

            <hr>
            <br>

            <p>
                To successfully incorporate a business systems integration process into the workplace, following these steps can effectively integrate 
                a business systems solution that aligns with a company's requirements, enhances communication, and streamlines your internal processes.
            </p>

            <br>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Assess Your Company's Requirements</b>:

                    <br>

                    Before embarking on the integration process, it is essential to assess a company's unique requirements. Evaluate what the organisation 
                    needs in terms of enhanced internal communications and data integration. Develop a comprehensive list of requirements that are intended 
                    to be incorporated into the system.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Conduct an Analysis</b>:

                    <br>

                    he next step involves conducting a thorough analysis of current systems. Typically, the IT team will take the lead in this phase as they 
                    possess the best understanding of the current system's potential and limitations. The goal is to identify viable approaches for meeting 
                    the list of requirements while ensuring the integrity of existing software systems. During this analysis, some requirements may be deemed
                    unfeasible, while others may seamlessly align with a company's software infrastructure.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Design Software Infrastructure</b>:

                    <br>

                    Following the evaluation of a current system, an IT team or an external source can proceed to design a software infrastructure system. This 
                    task is often entrusted to software developers. The software infrastructure design governs how data is collected, stored, and secured, taking 
                    into account the integration. Additionally, it outlines a plan for managing the new system, encompassing troubleshooting procedures, risk 
                    mitigation, and alternative options.

                </li>
                    
                <li>
                    <b>Design System Integration</b>:

                    <br>

                    Once the software design is ready to support the new integration system, IT professionals can proceed with designing the integration system 
                    itself. This step involves creating processes, maintenance tests, methods, and other logistical considerations. It is critical to ensure that 
                    the system integration method and the software design are compatible for a seamless transition.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Implement the Solution</b>:

                    <br>

                    The final phase of the process entails implementing the business systems integration solution within the company. While this stage may require 
                    some time, the ultimate outcome is a comprehensive and integrated system tailored specifically to an organisation's needs. Once the system is 
                    successfully implemented, it can then be used as part of a company’s daily operations.

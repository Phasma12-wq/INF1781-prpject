                <p>
                    The degree of accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and actionability of information is referred to as information quality. 
                    Simply put, it is the calibre of the result that is produced when the raw data is utilized for a specific purpose. 
                    Assessing and maintaining information quality often requires data quality management practices, data validation 
                    procedures, and the use of information quality standards. Various industries and organisations have specific standards 
                    and guidelines to maintain and improve the quality of their information assets. Comprehensively, in order to support 
                    improved decision-making and the accomplishment of organizational objectives, information quality management aims to 
                    guarantee that data and information are accurate, dependable, and suitable for their intended use.

                Information quality is a vital aspect of data management and decision-making, encompassing several critical factors 
                that determine the usefulness and reliability of data. In correlation to the above figure, these factors are namely:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Correctness</b>: When data contains mistakes, inconsistencies, or inaccuracies, the quality of the information is lowered.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Accuracy</b>: Information's quality and dependability are influenced by how closely it represents the actual situation.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Precision</b>: Exact details are provided for decision-making in high-quality information, which is specific and detailed.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Timeliness</b>: Information loses significance if it is unavailable when it is required to make defensible decisions.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Consistency</b>: Data that is consistent and free of contradictions upholds the quality of the information.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Completeness</b>:  Information quality is ensured and knowledge gaps are avoided when all required data elements are present.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Cost</b>: It's important to weigh the resources needed to gather and manage data against the quality of the information.
                       
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Conformity</b> to Needs and Expectations: When data conforms to requirements, information quality is attained.
                    </li>
                   
                </ul>

            <h2>Why the quality of information is important</h2>
            
            <hr>
            <br>

            <p>
                The quality of the information determines how much it can bring to business processes and, additionally, how much worth it has. That is why deficient information 
                can erode a positive connection over time. Low-quality information reduces the value of records when it is utilized for record keeping. In severe circumstances, 
                inaccurate information may cause problems with money or the law. Poor information results in inefficient time management and inferior choices from decision makers. 
                Information may establish a connection between an organization and its clients or members. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                Poor quality information is unable to accomplish these goals, therefore 
                the production division may create the incorrect products or quantities in an instance where it receives a poor-quality sales estimate.
